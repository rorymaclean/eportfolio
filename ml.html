												<h3>Unit 2: EDA</h3>
											</header>
											<p>After the introduction to machine learning, one of the most useful exercises was the EDA tutorial, 
												the focus of Unit 2. I have used EDA on many medical datasets, in particular focusing on missing 
												values, but I had not ever used the python package missingno before; this was very instructive, 
												especially the heatmap method to look for nullity correlation (Fig. 1), which I will use again in future EDA</p>

												<h3>K-means</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The next notable technique to be introduced in the module was clustering, we focused on K-means clustering. This is a very useful and informative technique, which I used in my coursework in a previous module to develop a prototype product to segment the customers of a hypothetical bank. It was useful however to return to this technique, as I learned about how to choose the optimal number of clusters. Going into the unit, I was aware that the number of clusters, k, is a parameter of the algorithm that must be chosen for each run. But it was useful to learn, through the workbook and seminar, that methods such as silhouette analysis can be used to check for the optimal (or approximately optimal) number of clusters </p>

												<h3>AirBnB Team Task</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The first team task to be undertaken was the AirBnB task. Here the problem setup was to define an important business question using the AirBnB listing dataset from Kaggle. Piotr and I discussed over video chat and had a range of hypotheses. However, we both agreed that the most important business question was around which factor affected the listing price the most. We moved from linear regression to XGBoost regression, a tree-based method. Whilst XGBoost has in-build feature importance, we decided instead to use permutation importance which is universal. I had heard about SHAPley additive explanations as a useful ‘explainable AI’ tool and explained this method to the team. Piotr thought it was great, and especially the visually interesting plots that show which are the influential variables</p>
